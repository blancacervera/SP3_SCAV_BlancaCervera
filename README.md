# SP3_SCAV_BlancaCervera

In this thir lab we are going to divide the main script in 4 different exercises.

# Exercise 1
Converting the videos we previously converted into 720p, 480p, 360x240, 160x120 now into:

VP8
VP9
h265 
AV1

# Exercise 2

Creating a script that will export 2 video comparision. In my case I compared the VP8 and VP9 ones and we can observe that, as expected, the VP9 has better quality than the VP8 one. 

# DISCLAIMER: For doing this exercise we need to first have compiled the first exercise as we need two videos created in that script.

# Exercise 3
Creating a script which can resize the BBB video into 4 differents video outputs 
1 - 720p
2 - 480p
3 - 360x240
4 - 160x120

# Exercise 4
Creating a script which can change the audio into mono output and then change this mono output into a different audio codec.
