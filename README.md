# SP3_SCAV_BlancaCervera

In this thir lab we are going to divide the main script in 4 different exercises. For all of these exercises I looked up some Internet webpages so that the lab was done correctly.

# Exercise 1
Converting the videos we previously converted into 720p, 480p, 360x240, 160x120 now into:

VP8
VP9
h265 
AV1

# Exercise 2

Creating a script that will export 2 video comparision. In my case I compared the VP8 and VP9 ones and we can observe that, as expected, the VP9 has better quality than the VP8 one. 

DISCLAIMER: For doing this exercise we need to first have compiled the first exercise as we need two videos created in that script.

# Exercise 3

Trying to achieve with FFMPEG a live streaming of the BBB_cut.mp4 video, in my case. I tried many times the live streaming but it does not seems to work in my VLC player.

# Exercise 4
Creating a script that let the user choose the IP to broadcast the previous video, that is to say, the same as exercise 3 but being able to choose in which IP we want to broacast it.
